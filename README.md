# Final-Project

This is the capstone project! Time to make all the skills you worked so hard for shine.

# Requirements

- A new project on data you gathered yourself. Existing datasets are OK but have a higher bar in terms of difficulty

- The project is deployed in some form -- it's not a static notebook, but has a server component.

- The project can be analysis/visualization or a model. If it's a model you should build an inference server for it taking JSON. If it's an analysis you can build a presentation page using something like https://dash.plotly.com/

- Submit the project on your own repo
